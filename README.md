## ðŸ’¬ **About the project**

Red Packet aims to gamify and make it easier to send gifts to their friends and family. It will also create a network effect and onboard the next billion people to web3 and blockchain. We are a multichain project and currently live on Polygon Mumbai, Celo, Cronos, Gnosis, Neon, and Ethereum. 

> **Multichain**, We have an agnostic deployment solution and with few commands the smart contract is deployed in different blockchain and frontend automatically reads the right contract address by blokchain.

> **FullStack Repo**, This repo includes both frontEnd and smart contracts files all together. It has a project structure facilitating a fast/clean integration and collaboration between backEnd and frontEnd team.

<br>

## ðŸš€ **Onboarding**

You will need a Windows, Mac or Linux computer with command line access and permission to install new system packages. An active Internet connection is required to install the following required software:

- Node https://nodejs.org/en/
- NPM https://www.npmjs.com/
- Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/

To initialize the project, using the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the project and run the `yarn install` command. This will install all the necessary packages and prepare your project for local development. Then you can use `yarn dev`
